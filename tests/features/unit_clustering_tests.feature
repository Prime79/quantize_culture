# Unit Test Level BDD - Clustering Functions
Feature: Clustering Evaluation Tests

  Scenario: Calculate silhouette score
    Given cluster labels and embedding vectors
    When I call calculate_quantitative_scores
    Then I should get silhouette score between -1 and 1
    And noise percentage between 0 and 100
    And cluster count greater than 0

  Scenario: Qualitative assessment scoring
    Given clustered sentences by theme
    When I call assess_clustering_qualitative_measures
    Then semantic coherence should be between 0 and 1
    And cultural alignment should be between 0 and 1
    And interpretability should be between 0 and 1
